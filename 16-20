//16 - Write a program to help keep track of grade boundaries.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
  int main()
  {
  
  int score;
  
  cout << "Input score: " endl;
  cin >> score;
  
  if (score > 100) {
  cout << "Invalid input. Maximum possible score is 100." << endl;
  }
  else if (score >= 70) {
  cout << score << " is an A." << endl;
  }
  else if (score >= 60) {
  cout << score << " is a B." << endl;
  }
  else if (score >= 50) {
  cout << score << " is a C." << endl;
  }
  else if (score >= 40) {
  cout << score << " is a D." << endl;
  }
  else if (score < 40) {
  cout << score << " is an F." << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
  }
  
  //17-18 - Write a program that checks if you can start a band!
  
  #include <iostream> <string>
  using namespace std;
 
  int main()
  {
  bool musicalFriend = true;
  string friendPlays = "guitar", "drum";
  
  if (musicalFriend == true) {
     if (friendPlays == 'guitar', 'drum') {
     cout << "The friend can join the band!" << endl;
     }
  }
  
  else {
  cout << "The friend cannot join the band." << endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
  }
  
  //19 - Write a program that follows mentioned rules.
  
  #include <iostream> <string>
  using namespace std;
  
  int main()
  {
  bool lateFriend = true;
  int totalMoney;
  
  if (lateFriend = true) {
     if (totalMoney >= 5)
     cout << "Buy a coffee." endl;
     } else {
     cout << "Go for a walk around town." endl;
     }
     
  else if (lateFriend = False) {
     cout << "Sit in the food zone and wait," endl;
  }
  
  return 0;
  }
  
  //20 - Write a program that reads magnitude from user and displays appropriate descriptor.
  
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main()
  {
  float magnitude;
  
  cout << "What is the magnitude of the earthquake? " endl;
  cin >> magnitude;
  
  if (magnitude < 2) {
  cout << "It is a micro earthquake." endl;
  }
  else if (magnitude >= 2) {
  cout << "It is a very minor earthquake." endl;
  }
  else if (magnitude >= 3) {
  cout << "It is a minor earthquake." endl;
  }
  else if (magnitude >= 4) {
  cout << "It is a light earthquake." endl;
  }
  else if (magnitude >= 5) {
  cout << "It is a moderate earthquake." endl;
  }
  else if (magnitude >= 6) {
  cout << "It is a strong earthquake." endl;
  }
  else if (magnitude >= 7) {
  cout << "It is a major earthquake." endl;
  }
  else if (magnitude >= 8) {
  cout << "It is a great earthquake." endl;
  }
  else if (magnitude > 10) {
  cout << "IT IS A METEORIC EARTHQUAKE." endl;
  }
  
  cin.get();
  return 0;
  }
